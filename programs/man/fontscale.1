.TH FONTSCALE 1
.SH NAME
    fontscale - get or set terminal font scale

.SH SYNOPSIS
    fontscale
    fontscale <n>
    fontscale <x> <y>

.SH DESCRIPTION
    Controls the terminal font scale factor. The Flanterm terminal
    emulator renders text at a configurable scale multiplier.
    Increasing the scale makes text larger, which is useful on
    high-resolution displays or real hardware where text may be
    too small to read comfortably.

    With no arguments, prints the current scale factor and terminal
    dimensions.

    With one argument, sets both the horizontal and vertical scale
    to the same value.

    With two arguments, sets asymmetric horizontal and vertical
    scale factors independently.

    Valid scale values are 1 through 8. After rescaling, the screen
    is cleared.

.SH OUTPUT
    fontscale
        Scale: 1x1 (160 cols x 50 rows)

    fontscale 2
        Scale set to 2x2 (80 cols x 25 rows)

.SH EXAMPLES
    fontscale           Show current scale and dimensions
    fontscale 2         Double the font size
    fontscale 3 2       3x horizontal, 2x vertical
    fontscale 1         Reset to default size
