.TH NSLOOKUP 1
.SH NAME
    nslookup - DNS hostname lookup

.SH SYNOPSIS
    nslookup <hostname>

.SH DESCRIPTION
    Resolves a hostname to an IPv4 address using the configured
    DNS server and prints the result.

    The kernel DNS resolver sends a UDP query to port 53 of the
    configured DNS server and waits up to 5 seconds for a reply.
    Results are cached in an 8-entry kernel cache with TTL support.

.SH OUTPUT
    Server:   10.0.68.1
    Name:     example.com
    Address:  93.184.216.34
    Time:     3ms

    If the lookup fails:

    Could not resolve: badhost.invalid

.SH DNS CONFIGURATION
    The DNS server address is obtained automatically via DHCP.
    It can also be viewed and set with ifconfig. The default
    is 10.0.68.1 (QEMU user-mode networking).

.SH EXAMPLES
    nslookup google.com
    nslookup icanhazip.com
