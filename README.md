## Ideology
The goal of the MontaukOS project is to create a modern and unique operating system that runs on both emulators and on real hardware. The kernel and included userspace applications are written in modern C++.

## History and methodology
Development started in early 2025, with the first published GitHub commit being on Feb 27, 2025. In early 2026, Claude Opus 4.6 began being used to accelerate development of the kernel and userspace.
